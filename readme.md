# postbot
This is the chess engine _postbot_ from postnerd written in Typescript/JavaScript.

## Goals
- have a lichess & uci bot for fame
- train my TypeScript skills
- train my unit test (jest) skills
- write clean, readable code (so this will maybe not the fastest bot alive)
- discover more goals

## Roadmap
- [x] ALPHA-01: setup with github / typescript / jest
- [x] ALPHA-01: board representation and move generator
- [x] ALPHA-01: uci / lichess communication with random moves
- [X] ALPHA-01: release a bot called postbotR to play random moves on lichess
- [X] ALPHA-02: board evaluation 1.0
- [X] ALPHA-02: search algorithm 1.0
- [X] ALPHA-02: use workers for search for not blocking engine communication
- [X] ALPHA-02: release a bot called postbot on lichess
- [X] ALPHA-03: deepen search on capture
- [X] ALPHA-03: implement alpha-beta search
- [X] ALPHA-03: sorted move candidates
- [X] ALPHA-04: detection for threefold repetition
- [X] ALPHA-04: have a basic evaluation function
- [X] ALPHA-04: hash tables include en passant information 
- [X] ALPHA-04: eval score caching
- [ ] define a real roadmap
    - [ ] null move pruning
    - [ ] move caching
    - [ ] performance optimizations
    - [ ] detecting 50 move rule

postbot is running on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## postbotR on lichess
The little brother of postbot, just playing random moves in casual games. A proof of concept to launch a chess bot on lichess.
