# Bugs

## Bugs
- [X] en passant should be reflected by hash generation
- [X] restructure hash tables to use low/high pairs of 32-bit integers to reduce hash collision
- [X] move ordering might be wrong (see discord conversation with Jonas)
- [X] isCheck not working with en passant
- [X] support for lichess movetime feature in the beginning
- [X] doesn't prevent checkmate in one - https://lichess.org/k0GCplgy/white#66 â€“ 6k1/1p4bp/6p1/4p3/2b5/2N3B1/PP4PP/5rKR w - - 7 34
